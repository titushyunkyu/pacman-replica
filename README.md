# Pac-Man Replica

## This project replicates the old Pac-Man game in python.

The game is written in Python utilizing Pygame and the University of Virginia's Game Engine (UVAGE). In order to run this program, installation of both Pygame AND UVAGE is necessary.

Pac-Man is a maze chase game where the player control's a character in a maze filled with coins. The objective of the game is for the player to successfully collect all of the coins within the map without colliding into a ghost within the given time.

Basic features include:
- Movement through the arrow keys for the user to control the Pac-Man's direction.
- Score and time indictaor on each side of the screen.
- Once the game is over (either through completion or failure), the user is prompted to either restart the game or quit.
- Ghosts' movements are completely randomized.
